### Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands is a chain of five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
